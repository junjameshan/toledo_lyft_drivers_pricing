## Background

Lyft is a ride-sharing and vehicles-for-hire as a service app that is mainly operating within the United States and parts of Canada. The app is used to request drivers by riders to take them from one destination to another for a price that is dynamically changing based on many factors such as time, location, and even weather as well. For this case study, how would you maximize the company's net revenue (the difference between the amount riders pay and the amount Lyft pays out to drivers) for the route from Toledo Express Airport to downtown Toledo for the next 12 months? 

**Core Question: How much more or less do you pay drivers per trip (by changing Lyft's take)? in order to maximize net revenue for Lyft for the next 12 months on this route.**

## Assumptions & Given Values 

In order to perform the analysis of the case study, it was imperative to take note of the given values and information in order to make educated assumptions. 

The following given values are as provided: 

**Current Prevailing Rates**

- Rider’s rate: $25 (This is the rate that riders will pay for a one-way route from Downtown Toledo to the airport or vice versa) 
- Driver’s wage: $19 (Rate that drivers will earn for their one-way route drive from Downtown Toledo to the airport or vice versa) 
- Wage rate percentage: ($19/$25) * 100% = 76% (This is the percentage of the total wages that drivers will earn for their drive) 
- Current Lyft take rate: $6/Ride (This is the rate that Lyft will earn as revenue for per drive)
- Current Lyft take rate percentage: ($6/$25) * 100% = 24% (This is the percentage of the total wages that Lyft will earn as revenue from a successful completion of a trip by a driver) 

**Experimental Pricing Rates**

- Experimental Lyft take-away price (Revenue): $3/ride 
- Increased Experimental Match Rate: 93% (From 60%, a 33% increase) 
- Based on the calculation shown below, it appears that for every $1 decrease in the revenue generated on Lyft’s end, there is an 11% match rate increase
- Change in Match Rate = ∆Match Rate / ∆Lyft Take Away Rate

**Unit Economics** 

- At the current rate, drivers are estimated to do roughly 100 rides/month
- At the current rate, riders request 1 ride/month on average

Once the given values were determined, it was necessary to make a few educated assumptions in order to conduct the analysis. Based on the information provided, what stood out for me were determining the estimated number of Lyft drivers in Toledo and the number of total passengers that would be commuting in and out of downtown Toledo to the airport in a month. After determining what values were missing, I was able to make an educated assumption on each value based on the research that I conducted: 

**Assumptions** 

-	No new drivers and riders will be signing up during this 12-month period and we will be only focusing on the current active users. 
-	The closest airport to Downtown Toledo is Toledo Express Airport, which is approximately a 30-minute commute one way. This is the airport that we will assume that travelers from Toledo will be commuting in and out from. 
-	I have estimated number of taxi drivers in Toledo to be 440. This value was calculated based on the estimated number of taxi drivers employed added by the increase in growing rate of 10% as referenced by the Trade College article. 
-	For this case analysis, we will assume that all 440 of the taxi drivers are also employed by Lyft.
-	I have estimated the total number of travelers into Toledo Express Airport to be approximately 179,911 passengers. We are using this value as this was the number estimated by the number of passengers at Toledo Express Airport in 2015 as referenced by the Toledo Blade article.
-	Based on the two closest nearing cities within Toledo (approximately <1-hour commute), I estimated the percentage breakdown of those who would be travelling to downtown Toledo from the Toledo Express Airport as opposed to the other two nearby cities based on the population size of each city:

1. Current population of Toledo estimated to be 267,503 people (Referenced by the world population review article.)
2. Current population of Detroit estimated to be 624,177 people (Referenced by the world population review article.)
3. Current population of Ann Arbor estimated to be 125,835 people (Referenced by the world population review article.)
4. Total of 1,017,515 people across all three cities 

- Based on population size, I broke down the total percentage of those who would be travelling to each of the city from the airport: 

1. Toledo: ((267,503/1,017,515) * 100%) * 179,911 = 47,298 average yearly travelers into Toledo  
2. Detroit: ((624,177/1,017,515) * 100%) * 179,911 = 110,364 average yearly travelers into Detroit
3. Ann Arbor: ((125,835/1,017,515) *100%) *179,911 = 22,249 average yearly travelers into Ann Arbor

- As estimated from the calculation, we can anticipate that in a year, approximately 47,298 travelers from the Toledo Express Airport will commute into Toledo or average of 3,942 travelers every month.
